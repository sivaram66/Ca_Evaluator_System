# Ca_Evaluator_System
**Project Description**:

The CA Evaluator System is a comprehensive software project designed to manage and facilitate the storage, computation, updating, searching, and deletion of student Continuous Assessment (CA) details. It serves as a valuable tool for educational institutions and organizations to efficiently manage CA-related data. The project comprises several modules to address various aspects of CA record management:
## Modules

1. **Create Record**:
   - This module allows users to input and store student CA details. Users can enter essential information such as student name, ID, course code, and CA marks. The system records this information and stores it securely.

2. **Search Record**:
   - The Search Record module enables users to retrieve specific student CA details quickly. Users can search for records by entering either the student's name or ID. The system provides a convenient way to locate and display student CA records.

3. **Modify Record**:
   - With the Modify Record module, users can update existing student CA records. If there are changes in a student's name, ID, course code, or CA marks, this module allows users to make these adjustments while maintaining data accuracy.

4. **Delete Record**:
   - The Delete Record module provides users with the capability to remove specific student CA records from the system. This is useful when records need to be removed due to student transfers, graduation, or other reasons.

5. **Display Record**:
   - The Display Record module offers a comprehensive view of all stored student CA records. Users can access a list of records containing student names, IDs, course codes, and CA marks. This module aids in obtaining an overview of the CA data stored within the system.
